This is a guide to DSA.

## Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

### Types of Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List: Each node points only to the next node.
- Doubly Linked List: Each node points to the next node and the previous node.
- Circular Linked List: The last node's "next" pointer points back to the first node (the head).

## Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

Stack operations include:
- push: Add an item to the top of the stack.
- pop: Remove an item from the top of the stack.
- peek: Get the top item of the stack without removing it.
- isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
